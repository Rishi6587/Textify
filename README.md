# Textify
AI-Powered Document Summarizer with Citation Tracking
This project is a web application that enables users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and receive concise, accurate summaries generated by the Google Gemini AI model. The backend extracts text from uploaded files, sends it to Gemini via API with a carefully crafted prompt, and obtains a clear summary highlighting the essential information. Additionally, the system extracts citations from the original text to help track references. The summarized text and extracted citations are then displayed on a user-friendly web interface.

Key features include:

Support for multiple document formats with reliable text extraction

Accurate and clear summarization leveraging Gemini AI

Citation extraction for APA and numeric references

Responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap

Python Flask backend with integration to Gemini API

Separate deployment of frontend (Netlify) and backend (Render) for scalability

This solution is designed to help professionals, academics, and legal users efficiently digest and navigate complex documents with improved comprehension and workflow efficiency.
